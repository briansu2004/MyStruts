# Why we still need Struts today

Struts is a web application framework for Java that was popular in the early 2000s. While Struts has been largely supplanted by more modern Java web frameworks like Spring MVC and JavaServer Faces (JSF), there are still some situations where Struts may be relevant or even necessary today. 

Here are a few reasons why organizations might still need Struts:

1. Legacy Systems: Many organizations have legacy applications built with Struts, and it can be costly and risky to migrate them to a more modern framework. In such cases, maintaining and supporting the existing Struts applications might be the most practical approach.

2. Stability and Reliability: Struts is a mature and stable framework. In scenarios where reliability and stability are of utmost importance, such as in critical business applications or government systems, Struts may still be a suitable choice.

3. Skill Set: If your development team is highly experienced with Struts and lacks expertise in other web frameworks, it might be more efficient to continue using Struts rather than investing time and resources in retraining the team on a different technology.

4. Small-scale Projects: Struts can be lightweight and suitable for smaller web applications. If you're developing a simple website or a small-scale project and you're already familiar with Struts, it may be an efficient choice without the complexity of learning a new framework.

5. Compliance and Regulations: Some industries or government sectors have strict compliance and regulatory requirements that necessitate the use of specific technologies, including older frameworks like Struts. In such cases, you may have no choice but to use Struts.

6. Maintenance Mode: If an application is in a maintenance phase and no new development is planned, it may not make sense to invest resources in migrating to a newer framework. In this scenario, you might continue using Struts to keep the application running smoothly.

It's important to note that while Struts can still be a viable choice in specific situations, there are drawbacks to using an older framework, such as potential security vulnerabilities, reduced community support, and limitations in terms of modern features and tools. If possible, it's generally recommended to consider migrating to a more modern framework to take advantage of the latest technologies and best practices in web development.

Many large organizations, including government agencies, continue to maintain legacy Struts applications, some of which even use Struts version 1. These organizations recognize the importance of staying current with technology trends to reduce technical debt, and they are actively engaged in the process of modernizing their applications.

In fact, a significant number of Java applications that originally used Struts, both version 1 and version 2, are currently undergoing conversion to Angular. Among the various frontend frameworks available, Angular is the preferred choice for government entities, surpassing alternatives like React or Vue.

<!-- Lots of legacy Struts apps (even v1) are still live in large organizations like governments.

Governments always want to catch up the tech trends (to get tech debts smaller) so they are always in the progress of the app modernization.

In fact, lots of the Java Struts (v1 and v2) are being converted to Angular apps today (Angular is most adopted by the Governments rather than React or Vue etc.). -->
